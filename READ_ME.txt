To install and run a Python script that splits a Word document into smaller documents based on word count using the python-docx library on a Windows 11 machine, you'll need to follow these detailed steps:

Step 1: Install Python
Ensure you have Python installed on your Windows 11 machine. If PyCharm, Python already be installed. You can check this by:

Opening Command Prompt (CMD).
Typing python --version and pressing Enter. If Python is installed, it will display the version number.
If Python is not installed:

Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
Step 2: Set Up PyCharm
Open PyCharm.
Create a new project:
Select File > New Project.
Choose a location for your project and ensure the correct Python interpreter is selected.
Click Create.
Step 3: Install python-docx
You need to install the python-docx library, which is used to manipulate Word documents:

In PyCharm, open the terminal (usually at the bottom of the PyCharm window).
Type the following command and press Enter:
Copy code
pip install python-docx
Step 4: Write the Python Script
In your PyCharm project, right-click on the project directory in the left sidebar.
Select New > Python File.
Name the file (e.g., split_word_document) and click OK.
Copy and paste the following Python script into your new file:
python
Copy code
from docx import Document

def count_words(doc):
    word_count = 0
    for para in doc.paragraphs:
        word_count += len(para.text.split())
    return word_count

def split_document(doc, words_per_file):
    new_doc = Document()
    words_current = 0
    for para in doc.paragraphs:
        words_in_para = len(para.text.split())
        if words_current + words_in_para > words_per_file:
            new_doc.save(f'split_{words_per_file}.docx')
            new_doc = Document()
            words_current = 0
        new_doc.add_paragraph(para.text)
        words_current += words_in_para
    new_doc.save(f'split_{words_per_file}.docx')

# Load your document
doc = Document('path_to_your_document.docx')
print(f'Total word count: {count_words(doc)}')

# Split document every 500 words
split_document(doc, 500)

Step 5: Run the Script
Replace 'path_to_your_document.docx' in the script with the actual path to your Word document.
In PyCharm, right-click on the script in the left sidebar and select Run.

This will execute the script, which reads the specified Word document, counts the total words, and splits the document into smaller files, each containing approximately 500 words. 
Each new document is saved with a filename indicating the split configuration. If you need to adjust the script to handle special formatting or other document elements, additional modifications might be necessary.
